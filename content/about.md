Hey there,

My name is Artem Hordynskyi (or _Gordinsky_, depending on how you transliterate it).

I really missed having my own website, so at the end of 2020 I decided to make one, just like we used to do "back in the day" (haha).

Not sure how best to characterize myself, but I guss I'm just your average nerd. I also love heavy metal music, among all kinds of other genres.

I've been tinkering with computers ever since I got my hands on one. That was around age 13, when my aunt got an old Windows 2000 machine. Apparently, this is considered very late in this industry. When I was 16, my parents were finally able to take out a loan and buy one as well, which was one of the best things that ever happened to me!  

For the past ~8 years, I've been getting paid to make websites. First, as I was freelancing from my own bedroom.
Then, as a job back in my hometown of Dnipro, Ukraine. And for the past 4+ years, in Amsterdam, Netherlands, which has been pretty great.
