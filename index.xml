      <description>Hey there,
My name is Artem Hordynskyi (or Gordinsky, if you transliterate my last name from Russian instead of Ukrainian).
It’s been a while since I had an actual website instead of relying solely on Twitter and Instagram for self-expression. Thanks to The Pandemic, I had some free time to buy this ridiculous domain name and whip something up using Hugo and GitHub Pages. Feels good having my own little corner “on the interwebs” again.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re reading the title of this post and thinking to yourself &amp;ldquo;A pandemic? That&amp;rsquo;s so 2020!&amp;rdquo; — then congrats, you&amp;rsquo;ve made it, humanity!
Alas, as I&amp;rsquo;m writing this in late 2020, most of the world&amp;rsquo;s developers (and, pretty much, everyone else who can) are still staying away from their companies&#39; offices and working from home in an attempt to flatten the curve of COVID19 infections.
If you were to ask everyone in the world to give 2020 a Yelp review then&amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s just say this year won&amp;rsquo;t top any charts.</description>
